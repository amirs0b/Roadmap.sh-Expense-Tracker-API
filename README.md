* Role-Based Access Control: Differentiates between user and admin roles, ensuring that users can only access and modify their own data, while admins have broader access.
* Complete Expense Management: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations allow for comprehensive management of expenses.
* Interactive API Documentation: Integrated Swagger UI provides a live, user-friendly interface for exploring and testing the API endpoints.
* Structured-Maintainable-Code: Follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern for a clean and scalable architecture.
* Robust Error Handling: Features a centralized error handling mechanism for consistent and predictable error responses.
